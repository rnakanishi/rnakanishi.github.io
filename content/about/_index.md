Hello! Thank you for stopping by.

My name is **Rafael Umino Nakanishi**. I have a Ph.D. degree in Computer Sciences and Computational Mathematics in the Fluid Simulation Field, residing in São Paulo, SP, Brazil. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and an MSc degree in Computational Mathematics. Currently I work as a **Pipeline Engineer** at [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/) since March 2021.

My interests are mainly on *Computer Graphics* topics, such as *Computer Animation*, *Numerical Simulation*, *Rendering*, etc. I hope I get an opportunity to work with those topics as an academic researcher or as a developer in the future.

Feel free to send a message, any suggestions, or critiques.
