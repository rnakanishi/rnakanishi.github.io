Hello! Thank you for stopping by.

My name is **Rafael Umino Nakanishi**. I have a Ph.D. degree in Computer Sciences and Computational Mathematics in the Fluid Simulation Field, residing in São Paulo, SP, Brazil. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and an MSc degree in Computational Mathematics. Currently I work as a **Pipeline Technical Dev** at [Assembly FX](https://assembly.tv) since January 2023.

In the past I've worked as Pipeline Engineer at Wildlife Studios (March, 2021 - November, 2022), in the Marketing dept, developing tools, such as animation rigs translation. In this project I have developed a tool using Maya for transcribing different rigs used by the Studio to Unity standard rigs, thus artists could used animations across different softwares. I have also designed the foundations for Assets libraries, using concepts of sub assets and asserts variations. Currently, at Assembly, I have mostly worked on developing Publish tools for cameras, assets, geometries, and other 3d elements created by artists. Along with the applications, I have also implemented the user interface using Python Qt libraries.

My interests are mainly on *Computer Graphics* topics, *Pipeline tools*, *Rendering*, etc. 

Feel free to send a message, any suggestions, or critiques.
